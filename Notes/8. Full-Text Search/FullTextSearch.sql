-- Full-Text Search
-- 1. Full-Text Search enables full-text queries against character-based data.
-- 2. It is an optional component of the SQL Server Database Engine, available only if enabled.
-- 3. To add the feature to an existing instance: SQL Server Installation Center → Add features to an existing installation.
-- 4. Full-text indexes support all character-based data types, including binary types that represent text files.
-- 5. Full-text queries perform linguistic searches against text data, following the rules of a specified language.
-- 6. A table can be full-text indexed only if it has a unique, single-column, non-nullable index.
--	+ Choosing a small index (e.g., 4-byte integer) reduces resource usage.
-- 7. By default, the system stoplist is applied to every full-text index.
--	+ Custom stoplists can be created and associated with specific indexes.
-- 8. Updating a full-text index immediately after each change can be resource-intensive.
--	+ Consider manual or scheduled change tracking updates.
-- 9. To reduce index fragmentation, rebuild or reorganize the full-text index.
-- 10. Compared with LIKE, Full-Text Search is faster and works on both character patterns and formatted binary data.
-- 11. Full-text queries support the following term types:
--	+ Simple: specific words or phrases.
--	+ Prefix: words or phrases where tokens begin with the specified prefix.
--		- Phrase prefixes can also match derivative or inflectional forms of each token.
--	+ Generation: inflectional forms of a word (FORMSOF(INFLECTIONAL)).
--	+ Proximity: words or phrases near each other (NEAR).
--	+ Thesaurus: synoyms defined in thesaurus files.
--	+ Weighted: terms with assigned relevance weights.
--	+ Queries can combine multiple terms, increasing complexity and resource usage.
-- 12. Full-Text Search architecture:
--	+ SQL Server process (sqlserver.exe):
--		- Query processor: compiles and executes queries, cooperates with Full-Text Engine for full-text queries.
--		- Full-Text Engine: compiles and executes full-text queries, applies thesaurus and stoplist rules.
--		- Thesaurus files: contain synonyms of search terms.
--		- Stoplist objects: contain common words excluded from searches.
--		- Full-text gatherer: schedules and drives population of full-text indexes.
--		- Index writer (indexer): build structures to store index tokens.
--		- Filter daemon manager: monitors the filter daemon host.
--	+ Filter daemon host process (fdhost.exe)
--		- Runs seperately under FDHOST launcher service, started by Full-Text Engine.
--		- Protocol handler: gathers data and passes it to the host.
--		- Filters: extract text from binary formats (.doc, .xls, .xml, etc.), remove formatting.
--		- Word breakers and stemmers: tokenize text and apply language-specific stemming.
--	13. Full-Text indexing process:
--	+ Full-Text Engine pushes batches of data into memory and starts the filter daemon host.
--	+ The host filters and word-breaks the data into tokens (keywords).
--	+ Optional processing removes stopwords and normalizes tokens.
--	+ Tokens are stored in full-text index fragments.
--	+ When population completes, fragments are merged into a master full-text index.
-- 14. Full-Text querying process:
--	+ Full-text portions of queries are passed to the Full-Text Engine.
--	+ Engine performs word breaking, thesaurus expansion, stemming, and stopword processing.
--	+ Queries are converted into SQL operators, primarily stemming table-valued functions (STVFs).
--	+ STVFs search full-text indexes for matches during execution.
-- 15. Full-Text index structure:
--	+ Full-text indexes may consist of multiple fragments; ideally, one master fragment is persisted.
--	+ A fragment is an internal table storing inverted index data, with columns:
--		- Keyword: token extracted at indexing time.
--		- ColId: column ID for the indexed column.
--		- DocId: document ID referencing the row in the table.
--		- Occurrence: position of the keyword within the document.
--	+ Each row of indexed text data is associated with a unique DocId.
