-- THREAD AND TASK ARCHITECTURE
-- 1. Request:
--	+ A request is the logical representation of a query or batch.
--	+ Each request can be assigned to:
--		- A single task (serial execution).
--			* Serial requests have only one active task at a time
--		- Multiple tasks (parallel execution).
--			* Parallel requests have one parent task and multiple child tasks.
--			* The parent coordinates child tasks and execute serial portions of the plan.
-- 2. Task:
--	+ A task is a unit of work containing instructions to execute.
--	+ It tracks the request's state and accumulative waits.
--	+ DMV: sys.dm_os_tasks shows task state and wait times.
--	+ A task requires a worker thread to run on a CPU.
--	+ Task states:
--		- PENDING: waiting for a worker thread.
--		- RUNNABLE: ready, waiting for CPU quantum.
--		- RUNNING: executing on a scheduler.
--		- SUSPENDED: has a worker, waiting on resources/events.
--		- DONE: completed.
--		- SPINLOOP: stuck in a spinlock.
-- 3. Workers / Worker Threads:
--	+ A worker thread is SQL Server's logical representation of an OS thread.
--	+ Managed by the SQL Server scheduler (SOS scheduler).
--	+ MAXDOP controls maximum worker threads for parallel requests.
--	+ DMV: sys.dm_os_workers shows worker states.
--	+ Worker states:
--		- INIT: initializing.
--		- RUNNING: executing (preemptive or non-preemptive).
--		- RUNNABLE: ready to run.
--		- SUSPENDED: waiting for an event signal.
-- 4. Schedulers:
--	+ SQL Server uses SOS scheduler to manage workers.
--	+ Each scheduler maps to a CPU.
--	+ Cooperative (non-preemptive) scheduling:
--		- Threads get a quantum (~4 ms).
--		- Must yield after quantum or when its task is finished.
--		- Maximizes CPU access and reduces blocking on resources (I/O, remote calls, etc.,).
--	+ Threads are distributed across CPUs in round-robin fashion.
-- 5. Best Practices (servers >64 CPUs):
--	+ Use ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION with SET PROCESS AFFINITY to bind processors.
--	+ Preallocate log file space to avoid auto-growth.
--	+ Configure MAXDOP for index operations.
--	+ Set maximum worker threads (starting point: ~7 x CPU count).
--	+ Avoid SQL Trace/Profiler in production.
--	+ Configure tempdb with multiple data files (generally one per CPU core).
-- 6. How SQL Server Uses Threads:
--	+ Each SSMS query window = seperate session.
--	+ Each ADO.NET SqlConnection  = seperate session.
--	+ A session can have multiple requests (seperated by GO keyword).
--	+ A request (batch) may contain multiple queries.
--	+ Queries may spawn multiple tasks/threads if parallel execution is chosen.
--		- Each batch has a sql_handle which refer to its sql/statement text, and query_hash generated from that text.
--		- For each batch, its plans are compiled or reused from cache, identified by plan_handle and query_plan_hash.
