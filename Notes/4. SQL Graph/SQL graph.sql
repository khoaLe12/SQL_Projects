-- GRAPH DATABASE
-- 1. Purpose:
--	+ Designed to model complex many-to-many relationships more naturally than traditional relational tables.
-- 2. Core concepts:
--	+ Nodes represent entities (e.g., Person, Product).
--	+ Edges represent relationships between nodes (e.g., FriendOf, Purchased).
-- 3. Unique features:
--	+ Edges can have attributes/properties (e.g., relationship strength, date).
--	+ A single edge can connect multiple nodes.
--	+ Supports pattern matching and multi-hop navigation.
--	+ Enables transitive closure and polymorphic queries.
-- 4. Node tables:
--	+ Each node table has an implicit pseudo-column: $node_id.
--	+ $node_id is automatically generated (combination of object ID + bigint).
--	+ SQL Server creates a unique nonclustered index on $node_id.
--	+ $node_id cannot be inserted or updated manually.
--	+ Selecting $node_id returns a JSON-like representation, with column name formatted as [$node_id_<unqiue suffix>].
-- 5. Edge tables:
--	+ Include three pseudo-columns: $edge_id, $from_id, $to_id.
--	+ $edge_id uniquely identifies an edge (object ID + bigint).
--	+ $from_id = $node_id of the source node.
--	+ $to_id = $node_id of the target node.
--	+ SQL Server creates unique nonclustered indexes in these columns.
--	+ $edge_id cannot be inserted or updated manually.
-- 6. Metadata views:
--	+ sys.tables → column is_node, is_edge identify graph tables.
--	+ sys.columns → columns graph_type, graph_type_desc list graph column types.
-- 7. MATCH function:
--	+ Used in WHERE clauses for pattern matching and traversal.
--	+ Defines paths from one node to another via edges, following arrow direction.
-- 8. SHORTEST_PATH function:
--	+ Recursively searches a graph until a condition is satisfied.
--	+ Path definition includes source node, edges, and nodes (FOR PATH keyword).
--	+ Arbitrary length patterns:
--		+ '+' → traverse until shortest path found.
--		+ '{1,n}' → repeat 1 to n times, stop at shortest path.
--	+ Useful path functions:
--		+ LAST_NODE → merge paths ending at the same node.
--		+ STRING_AGG → concatenate node values with a separator.
--		+ LAST_VALUE → return last node value in path.
--		+ SUM → sum attributes along path.
--		+ COUNT → count non-null attributes along path.
--		+ MIN → minimum attribute value along path.
--		+ MAX → maximum attribute value along path.
