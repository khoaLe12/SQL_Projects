-- LOGON TRIGGERS
-- 1. A logon trigger fires on the LOGON event when a new connection is established to a SQL Server instance.
-- 2. It executes after authentication but before the user session is fully established.
-- 3. Common uses include:
--	+ Auditing and tracking login activity.
--	+ Controlling or restricting server sessions.
-- 4. Multiple logon triggers can be defined:
--	+ Use the sp_settriggerorder system stored procedure to specify which trigger fires first and last.
--	+ The order of other triggers cannot be explicitly controlled.
-- 5. Transaction behavior:
--	+ When the first logon trigger fires, the transaction count is set to 0.
--	+ If the last trigger completes successfully and the transaction count remains 1, all logon triggers are considered successfully.
--	+ ROLLBACK TRANSACTION resets the count to 0 and cancels the login attempt.
--	+ COMMIT TRANSACTION is not recommended inside logon triggers, as it may interfere with transaction handling (might set count to 0).
--	+ If rolled back, all changes made by current and previous triggers are undone.
